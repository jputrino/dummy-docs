[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jputrino/test-deploy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jputrino/test-deploy)

This project can be used to test documentation tools for projects using sphinx. 
It's set up with the [f5-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-sphinx-theme) and uses the same scripts and tooling as the doc sets published on clouddocs.f5.com.
